Timetable Generator
=========

###About###
 - This is a timetable generator I wrote to learn javascript, so it has a lot of bad code in it!
 - You need to use node.js to run this, see Run.bat, this may work on Linux / Mac -- you will probably need to download the linux / mac modules though.
 - By default, this will run on port 1337, so visit: localhost:1337 to access the timetable generator.

###Icons###
 - Most of the icons are silk icons, which can be found [here] (http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/)
